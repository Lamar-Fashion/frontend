### List of Bugs:

DONE:
1- pagination not working as expected. (all option not working) & we should render 16 product per page. to fill the Abaya page.
8- order abayas by updated date.
3- resize all images (without cropping). //should be done. now all image is shown.
2- cart number in header. not synced on login/logout actions.
9- 569px - 531px width screen products cards broken (1 product per row, should be two)
10 - handle big image width & height on responsive //should be good now.
5- total price in cart gets too long in some cases.
11- put console.error in all catch blocks in the server.
6- messy data and incorrect price and product details if u select it from search in cart while u had different product booked.
7- handle productDetails page to be as a route.

TODO:
4- prevent users to see promoCodes object. (return admin settings without it). / split routes for adminSettings: one with authentication and for admins only. and the other one is open for all users.
